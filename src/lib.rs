/// Wrapper type that, when dropped, sends the inner value to a global
/// background thread to be dropped. Useful in cases where a value takes a
/// long time to drop (for instance, a windows file that might block on close,
/// or a large data structure that has to extensively recursively trawl
/// itself).
///
/// `DeferDrop` implements `Deref` and `DerefMut`, meaning it can be
/// dereferenced and freely used like a container around its inner type.
///
/// # Notes:
///
/// Carefully consider whether this pattern is necessary in your use case.
/// Like all worker-thread abstractions, sending the value to a separate
/// thread comes with its own costs, so it should only be done if performance
/// profiling indicates that it's a performance gain.
///
/// There is no way to receive a signal indicating when a particular object
/// was blocked; if you need such a thing, you should be dropping data in the
/// foreground.
///
/// There is only one global worker thread. Dropped values are enqueued in an
/// unbounded channel to be consumed by this thread; if you produce more
/// garbage than the thread can handle, this will cause unbounded memory
/// consumption. There is currently no way for the thread to signal or block
/// if it is overwhelmed.
///
/// All of the standard non-determinism threading caveats apply here. The
/// objects are guaranteed to be destructed in the order received through a
/// channel, which means that objects sent from a single thread will be
/// destructed in order. However, there is no guarantee about the ordering of
/// interleaved values from different threads. Additionally, there are no
/// guarantees about how long the values will be queued before being dropped,
/// or even that they will be dropped at all. If your `main` thread
/// terminates before all drops could be completed, they will be silently lost
/// (as though via a [`mem::forget`]). This behavior is entirely up to your
/// OS's thread scheduler.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use defer_drop::DeferDrop;
/// use std::time::{Instant, Duration};
///
/// let massive_vec: Vec<Vec<i32>> = (0..1000000)
///     .map(|_| vec![1, 2, 3])
///     .collect();
///
/// let deferred = DeferDrop::new(massive_vec.clone());
///
/// fn timer(f: impl FnOnce()) -> Duration {
///     let start = Instant::now();
///     f();
///     Instant::now() - start
/// }
///
/// let drop1 = timer(move || drop(massive_vec));
/// let drop2 = timer(move || drop(deferred));
///
/// assert!(drop2 < drop1);
/// ```
